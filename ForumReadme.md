Update: Now with RCS thrusters and better textures.

For a while now, I've been spending my spare time (the only good thing about not being able to find a job) fooling around in blender, creating a few KSP parts. Some may still require some additional work in order to be compatible with other mods, and the textures aren't as stockalike as I would like them to be, but I figured that other people might enjoy using these parts as well.

Included in this pack are:

**AKI-95 "Frog" Upper Stage**

Noticing a distinct lack of lightweight upper stages suitable for use with small probes, Albert Kerman Industries created this unfortunate-looking but versatile piece of equipment, which provides engine, fuel, monopropellant, control circuitry and reaction wheels in one compact, affordable package. Rumors of it being the evil hybrid offspring of a poisonous frog and a fuel tank are untrue.

The design was based off of the Russian "Fregat" upper stage, with the idea that it would be compatible with HGR's wonderful [stock-alike Soyuz parts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67164-HGR-R-D-Thread-Stock-like-Soyuz-Shenzhou-and-1-875m-parts-in-Development). However, it will fit nicely inside any 2.5-meter faring, with nothing clipping through.

This part has now been updated to include a reaction-control thrusters, as well as using an improved mesh. Also, with the update to 0.25, KSP aparently inproved how the game handles RCS, so no more uncontrolled spins from the Frog!

This part is especially useful if you want to have a proper upper stage underneath Beale's brilliant, stockalike [Fobos-Grunt probe](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81537-0-24-2-Tantares-Stockalike-Soyuz-and-TKS-9-1-2-Crew-1-25m-Pod-Fobos-Grunt!/page165) (although I'm fairly sure that the combination has way, way more delta-v than is needed for the mission, which is especially good if you're as much of an expert at messing up orbital mechanics as I am).

**CON-42 Radial Probe Core**

Manufactured by Ernest Kermin's Toy Shop and Model Rocketry Systems, this is a custom-built, lightweight, radial-mounted probe core, for all your part-controlling needs! No reaction wheels means light weight! (It totally isn't two model-car radio receivers crammed into a tiny pressurized tank, we swear!)

One of the more useful parts in this pack, this provides an inexpensive control core for, well, anything you can think of where a tiny, reaction-wheel-less probe core could prove useful.

**PB-ION Arc-Jet Propulsion System**

Manufactured by Ionic Symphonic Protonic Electronics in collaboration with Albert Kermin Industries, this engine is the unholy offspring of lightning and death itselfÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ actually, it resulted from a really bad laboratory accident which occurred after Bill left the welder attached to a monopropellant tank while fueling. However, it inspired the engineers to realize that running an electric arc through monopropellant made it a lot more explosive-y. This thruster was designed to take advantage of the newly discovered effect.

When I started creating this engine, the wonderful [RLA Stockalike](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90218) mod had yet to be updated to 0.24, and so I set out to create an equivalent part to their promised-for-the-next-version arcjet, with some small improvements to realism (it uses Monopropellant, not Xenon, as fuel)The day after I finished this mod, however, RLA was updated, including it's wonderful Arcjet.

Anyway, this engine is now on the market, at a vastly reduced cost*.

*Not true. Part cost remains the same.

**Upcoming-**

Ok, here's a short look at what parts I **may** be adding to this pack in the future-

**Hyper-toxic engines**



When the engineers at the Kerbin Chemical Consortium blew up one of their labs by combining two super-toxic chemicals, they instantly realized the potential for a new rocket fuel. Rockomax was quick to design an engine based around these super-cool new propellants.

I've almost got the engine finished, but I still need to create the fuel tank mesh.

This rocket was based around the [Pentaborane/ Oxygen difluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentaborane) propellants researched by the US and Russia doing the 60's and 70's. They were interesting propellants, with an extremely high specific impulse, just- well, one part per million in the atmosphere was an immediate threat to the health and safety of anyone exposed.

Balance wise, the fuel is as heavy as monopropellant, and costs about four times as much per unit. The engine has a specific impulse of 400s. Also, it would be realy neat to have a plugin that caused it to make a major reputation hit if fired and/or exploded inside Kerbin's atmosphere, but that's a bit beyond my skill level.

**Delta-K upper stage**



Designed to act as a base for KW rocketry fairings, as well as an upper stage, this slightly-smaller-than-2.5-meter part provides a hefty amount of delta-v.

Still needs a lot of work on the textures, obviously.

**Bugs:**

There was a major bug with the AKI-95 "Frog" upper stage, where the fuel tanks and engines were not appearing. It should now be fixed.
