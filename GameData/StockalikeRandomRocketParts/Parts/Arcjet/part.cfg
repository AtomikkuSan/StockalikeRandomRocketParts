description = This engine is the unholy offspring of lightning and death itself… actually, it resulted from a really bad laboratory accident which occurred after Bill left the welder attached to a monopropellant tank while fueling. However, it inspired the engineers to realize that running an electric arc through monopropellant made it a lot more explosive-y. This thruster was designed to take advantage of the newly discovered effect.
